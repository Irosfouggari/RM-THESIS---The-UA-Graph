# RM-THESIS---KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH
AUTOMATIC MAINTENANCE OF COVID-19 RELATED KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS BASED ON LARGE-SCALE INFORMATION EXTRACTION ON SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE


# Introduction

> This project inspired by knowledge graphs will attempt to provide assistance to people involved with research regarding COVID-19 which is todayâ€™s major global health concern. The proposed method involves the employment of knowledge graphs. Since COVID-19 pandemic began to spread, a plethora of publications have appeared and research towards a cure will be prevalent globally for some time to come. In other words, we will attempt to design a system which will explore knowledge graphs (browse and search), so as to assist researchers in finding papers relevant to their interests based on topics, quality, and connections with other papers.
